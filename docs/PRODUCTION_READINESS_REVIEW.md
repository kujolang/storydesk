# StoryDesk production-readiness review

## Verdict

StoryDesk 0.1.0 was a functional local-first foundation, not an honest universal enterprise-grade claim. This hardening pass makes it suitable for serious standalone editorial operations while keeping the remaining distributed-systems boundary explicit.

## Completed in this pass

- Split the runtime into focused `src/` modules and removed the obsolete root parser.
- Added strict command-specific contracts for ideas, campaigns, briefs, assignments, state transitions, blocking evidence, handoffs, and packets.
- Added JSON configuration, filtered and cursor-based bounded listing, atomic export, structured error codes, secret-field rejection, RFC 3339 timestamp validation, and explicit resource ceilings.
- Added atomic storage, per-record write locks, immutable IDs, append-only audit events, corrupt-record reporting, symlink rejection, and traversal protection.
- Expanded domain, security, storage, configuration, and regression coverage.
- Added pinned-runtime CI, a one-command validation gate, monochrome project badges, quick installation, operational guidance, and an explicit readiness posture.

## Evidence

Run `bash scripts/validate.sh`. It checks the Kujo entrypoint, all Kujo suites, JSON artifacts, CLI smoke paths, foreign-runtime boundaries, and whitespace integrity.

## Remaining boundary

StoryDesk is local-first and process-safe for per-record writes. It is not a distributed multi-host scheduler, hosted identity provider, or publication gateway. Those are explicit integration boundaries rather than hidden promises.

See [NEXT_SESSION.md](NEXT_SESSION.md) for the deliberately deferred enhancement list.
